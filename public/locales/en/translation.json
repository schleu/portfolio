      "p1": "Full Stack Developer, technology in Systems Analysis and Development from Cesumar. Single, {{age}} years old, resident in {{city}}. Passionate about sports, I am always looking to try new physical activities. In my free time, I like to explore recipes in the kitchen and disconnect with a good series",
      "p2": "I work as a full stack developer, but I have a much greater affinity for the logical and structural part of systems than the visual layer. I like to work with business rules, integrations, automations and well-defined architectures. My focus is on delivering robust, efficient and thought-out solutions to make life easier for those who will use them.",
      "p3": "I am driven by purpose. I love to learn, but I have difficulty updating myself with things I don't intend to use — my learning is much more effective when I understand the real utility of what I am studying.",
      "p4": "I value collaborative environments and I am always ready to help those who need it. I have a certain resistance to asking for help, and I only do it when I realize that I have exhausted all my attempts. Nevertheless, I have no problem assuming responsibilities or assuming the role of leader when necessary.",
      "p5": "I am a constant feedback culture — I like to listen to constructive criticisms and also offer feedbacks with empathy and clarity. I believe that professional growth comes from exchange, listening and continuous effort to evolve as a person and as a professional."
